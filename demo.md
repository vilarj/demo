# üìÑ General Description

The purpose of this demo is to give us insight into how you approach building a complete feature across the stack‚Äîfrom data modeling and API design to user interface implementation and usability. We are especially interested in your ability to reason through requirements, write clean and maintainable code, and demonstrate thoughtful decision-making, even in areas you may not fully complete due to time constraints.

This project is designed to take a few hours (3‚Äì4) for developers who have some familiarity with the relevant technologies (e.g., Typescript/JavaScript, React, Node.js). You are not expected to deliver a production-grade system‚Äîbut we do want to see your best effort at solving the problem thoroughly, with care and clarity.

### üí° Key Priorities

* **Code Quality**: Readable, modular, well-structured code is more valuable to us than breadth of functionality. If you‚Äôre short on time, prioritize polish over feature volume.
* **Full-Stack Understanding**: Try to implement all aspects of the stack‚Äîfrontend, backend, and data flow. Even if simplified, we want to see your ability to integrate components.
* **Creativity & Initiative**: If you identify areas where the experience could be improved (e.g., better UX, input validation, tooltips), we encourage you to explore them. Exceeding the spec isn‚Äôt required, but thoughtful touches are always welcome.
* **Problem Solving**: If you skip a requirement, be ready to talk us through how you would solve it. We want to understand your thought process and ability to break down a problem.


## üí° What We‚Äôre Looking For

This demo checks your ability to:

* Reason through realistic requirements
* Write functional, maintainable code across the stack
* Build basic UIs and connect them to APIs
* Communicate clearly and work independently

Good luck ‚Äî we‚Äôre excited to see your approach!

# Candidate Exercise Presentation Outline

[optional] it is optional to use the presentation slide. You can jump right into the code as well.
We have [PowerPoint template](../Cumulus%20Candidate%20Presentation%20Template.pptx) which covers an outline of what we would like to talk about during the first section of your interview before you share your craft demo. 
Feel free to use the template provided or make your own. For developers, we are more interested in your code than your PowerPoint skills, so plan your prep time accordingly.
When you show off your demo, we will ask you to show us how it works from a user's perspective (e.g., filling out the form and clicking "save"). 
After that, we will ask for a tour of your code with a focus on how you got the core functionality to work.

# üîç The Scenario

You are developing a web-based internal tool to support field operations for an industrial site. Technicians in the field use a variety of smart tools (such as torque wrenches, smart screwdrivers, and pressure gauges) to complete quality-critical tasks. These tools must be tracked and assigned to the appropriate personnel in order to ensure traceability, productivity, and safety.

Your task is to build a simple tool inventory and assignment application that:

* Displays a catalog of available tools
* Allows a supervisor to assign a tool to a technician
* Shows which tools are assigned and to whom

The UI should be intuitive, responsive, and optimized for efficient data display and interaction. Your design should make it easy to manage tools and understand their current status at a glance. You are encouraged to consider visual feedback, form usability, and information clarity when designing the interface.
